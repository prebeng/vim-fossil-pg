Introduction                                                          *fossil*
The plugin provides a set of vim commands for capturing the output of
fossil commands.  Captured output is generally captured in a temporary
buffer (see |:Fossil|, |:CFossil|, |:SFossil| and |:VFossil|), but can also
be inserted in the current buffer (see |:RFossil|).

Additional commands can be defined, e.g. `:Fdiff`, or `:Fstatus`, using
the |g:fossil_sub_cmds| variable.

Please see |fossil-variables| for further customisation.

For more information on fossil, see https://fossil-scm.org/.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands                                                     *fossil-commands*

:[{mods}]Fossil[!] [{arguments}]                                     *:Fossil*
        Run a fossil command and capture the output in a temporary buffer.
        To allow using %, |<cfile>| in {arguments}, any {arguments} that
        seem suitable for |expand()| are expanded before the temporary
        buffer is created.

        The window is split using |:split|, though this can be overridden by
        setting the |g:fossil_split| variable.

        See |<q-mods>| for possible {mods}.

        When the buffer is no longer displayed in a window, the default is
        to wipe it, though this can be tuned with |g:fossil_bufhidden|.

        When [!] is used, the command is run as an external command and the
        output is not captured.  See |:Rfossil| for inserting the output in
        the current buffer.
                                               *b:fossil_cmdline* *b:fossil_cmd*
        After creating the temporary buffer, the full command line is saved
        as `b:fossil_cmdline` and the first argument as `b:fossil_cmd`.
        Additionally, the current directory is set to |getcwd()| using |:lcd|.

:[{mods}]CFossil[!] [{arguments}]                                   *:CFossil*
        Capture version of |:Fossil|.  Only splits if using {mods}.

:[{mods}]SFossil[!] [{arguments}]                                   *:SFossil*
        Split version |:Fossil|, always adding |:split| agter any {mods}.

:[{mods}]VFossil[!] [{arguments}]                                   *:VFossil*
        Vsplit version |:Fossil|, always adding |:vsplit| agter any {mods}.

:[{range}]RFossil [{arguments}]                                     *:RFossil*
        Read the output of a fossil command into the current buffer after
        the current line, or the last line in {range}.

:FRefresh                                                          *:FRefresh*
        Refesh the buffers content by running |b:fossil_cmdline|, if set.

        The command is re-run in the directory that was current when the
        buffer was created (see |b:fossil_cmdline|).

        To perform an auto-refresh when swithing to a window with a temporary
        |:Fossil| buffer, if containg specific fossil output, use e.g.
>
    :let g:au_fossil_referesh = ['changes', 'extra', 'status', 'timeline']
    :au BufEnter {} if exists("b:fossil_cmd")
                 \|   if index(g:au_fossil_referesh, b:fossil_cmd) != -1
                 \|     FRefresh
                 \|   fi
                 \| endif

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tab completion                                             *fossil-completion*

The default commands completes based on the following steps:

1. The first argument completes fossil command names.
2. Arguments starting with `-` uses applicable fossil command options.
3. Other arguments completes file names using |glob()|.

Commands created based on g:fossil_sub_cmds, like |:Fdiff|, use completion
steps 2. and 3. above.

NOTE: The lists of options are auto generated from `fossil help -a -v`.
      For fossil commands with sub commands, all options for any of the
      sub commands is included.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plugin variables                                            *fossil-variables*

                                                          *g:fossil_bufhidden*
If set, used for the |'bufhidden'| option for temporary buffers.

                                                              *g:fossil_chdir*
If set, use `fossil info` to find the local-root for the current buffer and
compare with the local-root for the current directory:

1. If there is no local-root for the current buffer, show an error message.
2. If there is no local-root for the current directory, or if it differs
   from local-root for the current buffer, use `fossil --chdir ROOT` where
   ROOT is the local-root for the current buffer.
3. Otherwise, run fossil `without` --chdir.

                                                                *g:fossil_cmd*
If set, use g:fossil_cmd instead of the default `fossil` to run commands.

                                                         *g:fossil_short_cmds*
The plugin will create short name versions of the commands, where e.g.
>
    :let g:fossil_split = ['F', 'CF', 'RF', 'SF', 'VF', 'FR']
<
would create all of the possible short name commands:

:F      As |:Fossil|, added if "F" is in g:fossil_short_cmds        *fossil-:F*
:CF     As |:CFossil|, added if "CF" is in g:fossil_short_cmds      *fossil-:CF*
:RF     As |:RFossil|, added if "RF" is in g:fossil_short_cmds      *fossil-:RF*
:SF     As |:SFossil|, added if "SF" is in g:fossil_short_cmds      *fossil-:SF*
:VF     As |:VFossil|, added if "VF" is in g:fossil_short_cmds      *fossil-:VF*
:FR     As |:FRefresh|, added if "FR" is in g:fossil_short_cmds     *fossil-:FR*

                                                              *g:fossil_split*
The value of `g:fossil_split` is added after any modifiers specified on the
command line (see |<q-mods>|).  The value, if not empty, must include a final
|:split| or |:vsplit|, e.g.
>
    :let g:fossil_split = ''                    " Like :CFossil
    :let g:fossil_split = 'vsplit'              " Like :VFossil
    :let g:fossil_split = 'belowright vsplit'   " Using a modifer
<
                                                           *g:fossil_sub_cmds*
If you set `g:fossil_sub_cmds` to a list of fossil sub commands, the plugin
will create custom commands.  For instance, if you set this in your |vimrc|,
>
    :let g:fossil_sub_cmds = ["diff"]
<
the following commands are created:

:Fdiff      Equivalent to running `:Fossil diff`                       *:Fdiff*
:CFdiff     Equivalent to running `:CFossil diff`                      *:CFdiff*
:RFdiff     Equivalent to running `:RFossil diff`                      *:RFdiff*
:SFdiff     Equivalent to running `:SFossil diff`                      *:SFdiff*
:VFdiff     Equivalent to running `:VFossil diff`                      *:VFdiff*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax highlighting                                            *fossil-syntax*

The syntax highlighting highlights output in `fossil commit` messages as well
as output of e.g. `fossil` `status`, `timeline`, `praise` and `help` commands.
